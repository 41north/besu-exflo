## How to report a bug

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check the [before-submitting-a-bug-report](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) checklist as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Confirm the problem** is reproducible in the latest version of the software.
- **Perform a [cursory search of project issues](https://github.com/41North/exflo/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [Github issues](https://github.com/41North/exflo/issues).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive summary** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Exflo, e.g. which command did you use in the terminal, or were you running it as a run profile in Intellij etc.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use backticks (```) to format them.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of the software) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of the software?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
- **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

- **Which version of the software are you using?**
- **What OS & Version are you running?**
  - **For Linux - What kernel are you running?** You can get the exact version by running `uname -a` in your terminal.
- **Are you running in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
- **Are you running in a docker container?** If so, what version of docker?
- **Are you running in a a Cloud?** If so, which one, and what type/size of VM is it?
- **What version of Java are you running?** You can get the exact version by looking at the besu logfile during startup.

## Submitting changes

We accept contributions via regular Pull Requests (PRs) on [Github](https://github.com/41North/exflo). Below there's a list of rules to follow whenever you want to send a PR:

- **Create feature branches**: It's important to be concise with your commits, so don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **Add tests if applicable**: Your patch probably won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests (but will depend on the situation).
- **Document any change in behaviour**: Make sure the `README.md`, Postman files and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **One pull request per feature**: If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history**: Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

We will review your Pull Request as soon as possible!

## Style guides

### Commit messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard. Here is a brief summary:

Format:

`type(component): message (github issue number with #)`

Message types:

- **feat** is used when new feature is provided;
- **wip** is used when making regular commit and changes don't match any other types;
- **fix** is used when you fix a bug;
- **chore** is used when changes are about organization, not about logic;
- **docs** is used when you add/change documentation.

Component is a decomposition unit your commit affected. Write the message in present simple.

Examples:

```
feat(logger): add rotating
chore: remove redundant commas, add copyright
wip: pass models to routers
fix: program exit is prevented when button is pressed (COMP-1, #123)
```

### Kotlin style guide

We are using [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html). To reformat code, run:

```sh
$ ./gradlew ktlintFormat
```
