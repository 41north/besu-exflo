    A plugin for the <a href="http://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/">Besu</a> enterprise-grade Ethereum client with the aim of making it easier to extract chain data into a variety of different data stores and processing pipelines. <br/> Written with ‚ù§Ô∏è in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a>.
</p>

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This project is in alpha stage, and we are working actively!

## üóíÔ∏è Features 

Exflo can extract the following information from a Besu archive instance into either a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database or a [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) topic:

- Block headers.
- Transactions.
- Transaction traces.
- Log events for standards-compliant [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), [ERC777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) and [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens.
- Detailed breakdown of Ether movements e.g. block rewards, tx fees, simple ether transfers and so on.
- Contract creations and self destructs.
- Per block account state changes.

## üöÜ Quickstart

Before continuing ensure you have the following programs installed:

* Java 11 or higher ([AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/), [Zulu Community](https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-community/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/))
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/blob/master/docs/installation.md)
* (Optional but highly recommendable) [IntelliJ IDEA Community or Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:41north/exflo.git
```

Generate Intellij run configurations:

```bash
./gradlew generateIntellijRunConfigs
```

Decide which data store you want to run:

For Postgres:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.exflo-postgres.yml up
```

For Kafka:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.exflo-kafka.yml up
```

Wait for each docker service to be properly initialized (being those Postgres or Kafka respectively). 

After that, inside Intellij, execute accordingly the Run config:

For Postgres
```text
BESU | Ropsten | Postgres > Run
```

Or for Kafka:

```text
BESU | Ropsten | Kafka > Run
```

Open your browser and navigate to `[http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)` and you will be greeted with either `pgweb` or `kafkahq` respectively.

## Usage with Besu

There are two possible ways of running Exflo. Choose whatever suits you for your particular usecase and necessities:

### Jar

This method is like running a regular Besu plugin (assuming you're using Docker to execute Besu):

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/41North/exflo/releases) and download the `tar` or `zip` file and extract it.
2. [Besu docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/besu) exposes a `/etc/besu/plugins` folder where it loads the jars.
3. Add a bind volume where to put the jar.
4. If you want to tweak default params, we recommend you to take a look on the [usage section](#usage).

Here's an example of a possible `docker` configuration using `docker-compose` syntax:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  besu:
    image: hyperledger/besu:1.4.4
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/exflo-jar/:/etc/besu/plugins
    command: "--plugin-exflo-kafka-start-block-override=23 --plugin-exflo-kafka-max-fork-size=512"
```

We recommend you to have a look on the [usage section](.github/USAGE.md), so you can tweak easily the params to your fitting.

### Bundled docker images

We also offer bundled docker images with Besu to ease even more its usage:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  besu:
    image: 41north/exflo:latest
    command: "--plugin-exflo-kafka-start-block-override=23 --plugin-exflo-kafka-max-fork-size=512"
```

We recommend you to have a look on the [usage section](.github/USAGE.md), so you can tweak easily the params to your fitting.

## ‚ùî FAQ

### Why Besu?

We chose Besu for several reasons:

1. It is enterprise ready.
2. It is written in Java, which allows us to work in Kotlin
3. It has a modern codebase with good patterns and documentation.
4. There is a plugin system allowing for customisation and integration without the need to maintain a fork.
5. Their [community is open and welcoming](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/besu) (we recommend you join!).

### Why not use the Web3 interface that every Ethereum client has?

If you have ever tried this you will quickly realise that extracting even just the basic information from an Ethereum client via the Web3 
interface requires a lot of requests and some non-trivial logic to do well. On top of that, depending on the client 
(we won't name anyone in particular) you may find that under heavy load, such as when syncing for the first time, your client may become 
unstable and periodically core dump. Maximising throughput whilst keeping the client happy quickly becomes a tedious exercise.

Put simply it has been our experience that pulling via the Web3 interface is sub-optimal for a variety reasons which are better explored 
in a blog post.

### Why Kafka and Postgres? Is it possible to develop more data stores?

TBW

### Can we replace RocksDB storage engine with Exflo?

TBW
